## My Work

Take a look at some of my recent projects to see what I can do:

- [TEF6686 FM Tuner](https://github.com/NoobishSVK/TEF6686-remastered): An improvement of PE5PVB's firmware. This version is made for portable tuners which include battery support, remote control over Wi-Fi and more neat features!
