# Welcome to my GitHub profile! âš¡

Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is **Marek FarkaÅ¡** (you can call me Noobish though!) and I am a jack of all trades IT person, however I specialize in front-end web & desktop app development using raw HTML/CSS/JS, Electron & NodeJS.

I hope you enjoy exploring my GitHub profile, and if you have any questions or would like to work with me, please don't hesitate to [contact me](#contact). I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges, and I'd love to hear from you! ðŸ¤—

## Languages

I can speak the following languages:

ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡° Slovak | ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ Czech | ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English | ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± Polish

## My most important projects

Take a look at some of my recent projects to see what I can do:

### JS
- [Specinator](https://specinator.net): An app that allows users to view their device's specifications with a user-friendly interface, as well as the option to share the information with one button. ðŸ“±
- [DiscordSpecsRP](https://github.com/NoobishSVK/DiscordSpecsRP): A separate app (although also included as a feature in Specinator) that shows everyone on Discord your device's specs using Discord's Rich Presence API.

### C++
- [TEF6686 FM Tuner](https://github.com/NoobishSVK/TEF6686-remastered): An improvement of PE5PVB's FM Tuner firmware. This version is made for portable tuners which include battery support, remote control over Wi-Fi and more neat features!
